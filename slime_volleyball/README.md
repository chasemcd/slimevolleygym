# Slime Volleyball

Slime Volleyball was developed by David Ha and the original repository is available here:
https://github.com/hardmaru/slimevolleygym.


Here, we simply reorganize some of the files and provide a wrapper for it to work with RLLib. Additionally, 
we update it from `gym` to `gymnasium`.
